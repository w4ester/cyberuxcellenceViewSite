The CSS selectors:

```css
.logo {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100%;
}
.logo a {
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100%;
}
```

refer to the navigation logo area in your navbar, specifically this HTML structure in index.html:

```html
<nav class="main-nav">
  <div class="container">
    <div class="logo">
      <a href="/">
        <div class="logo-wrapper">
          <span class="logo-text">
            <span class="logo-cyber">CYBER</span>
            <span class="logo-uxcellence">UXCELLENCE</span>
            <span class="logo-awards">AWARDS</span>
          </span>
        </div>
      </a>
    </div>
    <!-- ...nav links... -->
  </div>
</nav>
```

**Purpose of These Rules:**
- `.logo` targets the logo container div, making it a flex container and ensuring its children (the link) are vertically centered and stretch to the full navbar height.
- `.logo a` applies the same flex centering to the anchor, so that whatever is inside (the logo text and graphics) is also centered and fills the navbarâ€™s height.
- This ensures the logo is always perfectly vertically centered and aligned with the rest of the navbar content, regardless of height or content changes.

This structure is a common architectural pattern for responsive, well-aligned navigation bars.


To achieve your goals:

**1. Make the Navbar Taller**
- In `css/global.css`, adjust the `--nav-height` variable in the `:root` selector. For example, to make it 88px:
  ```css
  :root {
    /* ...other variables... */
    --nav-height: 88px; /* was 78px */
  }
  ```
- Because `.main-nav` uses `height: var(--nav-height);`, this will increase the navbar's height throughout the site.

**2. Add More Padding to "Powered by Mindgrub" Text (Footer Copyright)**
- The relevant selector is likely `.copyright` or `.copyright-container` in your footer. To increase padding, add or adjust in your CSS:
  ```css
  .copyright {
    padding: 16px 0; /* Increase top/bottom padding */
    /* Or, for more space on all sides: */
    /* padding: 16px 24px; */
  }
  ```
- You can further target `.copyright-container` if you want to control spacing around the entire area.

**Patterns/Best Practices:**
- Use CSS variables for layout consistency and easy updates.
- Use semantic class names and target the smallest scope possible for your padding/margin changes.

**Summary:**  
Increase the navbar height by updating `--nav-height` in `:root`. Add more space to the "powered by Mindgrub" text by increasing padding on the `.copyright` or `.copyright-container` class in your CSS footer area.


To make the navigation (navbar) link text larger, update the CSS for `.nav-links a` in `css/global.css`. Currently, it uses:

```css
.nav-links a {
  ...
  font-size: 1.00rem;
  ...
}
```

**Architectural Recommendation:**
- Increase the `font-size` property to your desired size. For example, to make the navbar text noticeably larger, you might use:
  ```css
  .nav-links a {
    font-size: 1.25rem; /* or 1.5rem for extra large */
  }
  ```
- This will scale all navigation link text proportionally while maintaining your modular, section-based architecture.

**Additional Notes:**
- If you want to also increase the size of the wordmark logo text, target `.logo-text` and its children (e.g., `.logo-cyber`, `.logo-uxcellence`, `.logo-awards`) and increase their `font-size` as needed.
- Adjust the `--nav-height` CSS variable if the larger text requires more vertical space for comfortable alignment.

This approach keeps your design modular and ensures consistent scaling across all navigation text elements.
