**Summary of Changes:**

This branch focuses on improving the visual appearance and spacing of elements in the website's header and between sections.

1.  **Navbar Logo Spacing:**
    *   **Goal:** To prevent the logo text in the navbar from appearing vertically compressed.
    *   **Implementation:** Increased the overall height of the navbar by adjusting the `--nav-height` CSS variable in `css/global.css` from `72px` to `76px`. This provided more vertical space for the logo text to breathe.
    *   **Additional Adjustment:** Added `position: relative;` and `top: 4px;` to the `.logo-wrapper` in `css/global.css` to nudge the logo down slightly, increasing the space above it.
2.  **Section Overlap Fix:**
    *   **Goal:** To remove a thin purple line that was visible between the "About" section (specifically the red quote block within it) and the "Categories" section.
    *   **Implementation:** Reduced the negative `margin-top` on the `.categories-section` in `css/categories.css` from `-40px` to `-30px`. This reduced the amount the "Categories" section was pulled upwards, eliminating the visual artifact caused by the section overlap.

These changes collectively improve the visual polish and overall aesthetic appeal of the website by addressing spacing and layout issues in the header and between key content sections.
