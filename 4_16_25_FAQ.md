FAQ’s:
What materials are required for nomination?
- [ ] Update the FAQ section where there are new questions and answers listed.
To submit a nomination, you will need to provide detailed information about your product's UX and UI features, its impact on users, and any supporting materials such as user testimonials, case studies, product demos or video clips that highlight the product's UX/UI strengths as it relates to the submission category you select.


How long does it take to complete the nomination process? 
Old remove: The nomination process is fast, intuitive, and flexible. Our user-friendly online platform allows you to start, save, and refine your submissions with ease. You can also duplicate entries across different categories, making it quick and simple to nominate your product in one or multiple award categories.

Use this New Answer instead:
We recommend setting aside at least 30 minutes to complete your submission. Be sure to review the entire form in advance so you can gather all necessary materials beforehand. Please note that the form does not require a login, which means you won’t be able to save your progress and return later — it must be completed in one session.


Can we submit the same product for multiple categories?
old: Yes, you can submit your product for multiple categories if it meets the criteria for each one.

Use New Answer: No, this year each company may submit to only one category. We recommend selecting the category that best represents your strongest work.  


How are winners selected? (still being reviewed leave as is for now)
Submissions are evaluated by a distinguished panel of judges representing top industry CISOs, UX experts, and cybersecurity thought leaders.
Each submission is assessed based on predefined published rubric criteria, including UX/UI design, usability, adoption rates, impact on security outcomes, and overall user experience. Judges evaluate entries according to the specific category descriptions.


When will I know if I won or am a finalist? (leave as is...it is good)
Winners will be notified via email during the judging period and will be announced at the awards ceremony during Black Hat 2025 in Las Vegas. You do not need to attend the Black Hat event to win. Winners will be recognized and celebrated during the awards ceremony at Black Hat 2025.
