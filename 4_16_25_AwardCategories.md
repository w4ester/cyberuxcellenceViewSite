Step 1: Analyze the user's request and objectives.
- User wants to update sections according to 4_16_25_AwardCategories.md.
- Wants a clear plan/checklist before implementation, with progress tracked and marked off.
- Wants a deep understanding of what needs to change and where, before passing coding to the next role.

Step 2: Review the workspace for relevant files.
- The project contains both content files (MD), HTML section files, and category-specific CSS/JS.

Step 3: Determine the required actions:
- Review 4_16_25_AwardCategories.md to extract required updates/sections.
- Cross-reference with related files: sections/categories.html (and possibly categories-mobile.html), js/categories.js, css/categories.css, and any other section files mentioned.
- Create a checklist for the required section updates, referencing which files are affected and what changes are needed.
- Only after a clear, actionable plan is made, proceed to delegate code changes to the appropriate roles (Gnome for new modules/features, Fable for tweaks).

Step 4: Required information to proceed:
- I need to read and analyze 4_16_25_AwardCategories.md to extract the intended updates, structure, and points of change.

Plan:
1. Read and analyze 4_16_25_AwardCategories.md to extract all section updates or instructions.
2. Map out which files in the project will need to be updated for each item in the checklist (e.g., categories.html, categories.js, categories.css, etc.).
3. Draft a precise step-by-step checklist with files to update, what to update, and mark points for verification.
4. Only after full understanding and checklist creation, delegate implementation steps to the next code role.

First, I will read the entire 4_16_25_AwardCategories.md to gather requirements.
