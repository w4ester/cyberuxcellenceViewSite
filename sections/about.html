        The <strong>Cyber UXcellence Awards</strong> recognize cybersecurity products that set the standard for exceptional <strong>user experience (UX) and user interface (UI)</strong>.
      </p>

      <p class="about-description">
        Security tools should be powerful, but they also need to be intuitive, efficient, and easy to use. Despite this necessity, many in the industry still overlook or undervalue how good UX and UI design can significantly enhance security. If a product is difficult to navigate, slows workflows, or requires extensive training, it risks being underutilized. Great UX ensures security solutions are adopted, trusted, and effective.
