# Favicon Implementation for a Single-Page Modular Website

## Understanding Your Website Architecture

Based on your description, you have:
- A single-page website where `index.html` is the main entry point
- Modular HTML files in the `sections/` folder that are loaded into the main page
- A structure where CSS, JS, and HTML sections are organized separately

## Where to Add the Favicon Code

For a single-page website with modular components, you only need to add the favicon code to the `index.html` file.

### Explanation:

The favicon is loaded by the browser based on the HTML `<head>` section of the page that's directly accessed via URL. Since users are only directly loading your main `index.html` file (and not accessing the section HTML files directly), the favicon only needs to be defined once in that main file.

The modular HTML files in your `sections/` folder are:
- Not typically accessed directly by users
- Loaded into the main page through JavaScript or other inclusion methods
- Not responsible for defining page-level metadata like favicons

## Implementation Instructions

1. Open only your main `index.html` file
2. Find the current favicon line (line 10):
   ```html
   <link rel="icon" href="assets/images/favicon.ico">
   ```
3. Replace it with:
   ```html
   <!-- Animated GIF favicon (primary) -->
   <link rel="icon" href="assets/images/icons/MindgrubBulb_Animated.gif" type="image/gif">

   <!-- PNG fallback for browsers that don't support animated GIFs -->
   <link rel="icon" href="assets/images/icons/fallbackFavicon_MindgrubBulb_Animated.png" type="image/png">
   ```
4. Save the file

There's no need to modify any of the HTML files in your `sections/` folder.

## Testing

After implementing the change to your main `index.html` file:

1. Load your website in a browser
2. Check if the favicon appears in the browser tab
3. Try different browsers to ensure both the animated version (Chrome, Firefox) and static fallback (Safari) work correctly

If your section files are ever meant to be accessed directly via URL (e.g., `/sections/about.html`), then you would need to add the favicon code to those files as well. However, based on your description of a single-page modular website, this shouldn't be necessary.
