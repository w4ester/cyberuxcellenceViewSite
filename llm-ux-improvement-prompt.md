## **Objective**

Conduct a comprehensive review and update of the Cyber UXcellence Awards website to achieve top-tier, professional user experience (UX). Use the existing markdown documentation as authoritative implementation guides. Your goal is to ensure design, content, spacing, color, and section structure are all consistent, visually appealing, and aligned with the brand guide.

## **Instructions for LLM**

1. **Project Understanding**
    - Begin by thoroughly reviewing the project’s structure, core files, and brand guidelines (see `/assets/images/Cyber-UXcellence-Award-Brand-Guidelines.pdf`).
    - Identify all HTML, CSS, and asset files relevant to the site’s appearance and user flow.
    - Read the following markdown documentation files in full before making any changes:
        - `makechangesnow.md`
        - `section-spacing-architecture.md`
        - `AboutSection.md`
        - `WhyNominateYourProduct.md`
    - Understand the intent, rationale, and step-by-step fixes described in these files.

2. **Section-by-Section Updates**
    - Follow the process outlined in `makechangesnow.md` to systematically update each section:
        - Reference each section’s markdown plan as you proceed.
        - Apply the required changes to the specific files and code locations listed.
        - Use variables from `css/global.css` for all colors and spacing.
        - Confirm all colors, fonts, and layouts match the brand guide.
        - Remove any ad-hoc or inconsistent spacing, negative margins, or outdated design elements.

3. **UX Maximization Principles**
    - Ensure all updates reinforce professional, best-in-class UX:
        - Consistent spacing and alignment between sections
        - High contrast and brand-aligned color usage
        - Clear, accessible typography and hierarchy
        - Responsive layout for all devices
        - Visual emphasis where appropriate (e.g., hero, benefit cards)
        - Cohesive card/grid patterns for benefit/why sections
    - Regularly check your changes against the brand guide for color, spacing, and font accuracy.

4. **Testing and Verification**
    - After completing updates for each section, visually inspect the site for:
        - Section alignment and spacing consistency
        - Card and content appearance (no unintended overflow or gaps)
        - Correct font and color use
        - Responsive behavior on both desktop and mobile
        - Accessibility and contrast

5. **Documentation and Comments**
    - Where appropriate, comment your code with references to the markdown plan and section being updated.
    - Document any deviations from the markdown guides and explain the rationale.
