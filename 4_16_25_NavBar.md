# NavBar Section

## Prompt
You are an LLM tasked with updating the **NavBar** on our site.  
1. Review the checklist below.  
2. Draft a step‑by‑step plan for implementing each change.  
3. As you apply each update in code, mark the box from `[ ]` to `[x]`.  

## Plan
- [ ] Inspect current `NavBar` markup & CSS.  
- [ ] Identify where the “Nominate Now” button should live. And match the Nominate Now button already in Timeline and Hero. 
- [ ] Adjust padding around the logo wordmark.  
- [ ] Re‑add missing “Nominate” button if removed.  
- [ ] Test responsiveness in desktop & mobile.  

## Checklist
- [x] Nominate now Button add to navbar
- [x] More padding for logo word mark that is separated by the words CYBER UXCELLENCE AWARDs with Powered by Mindgrub in the word mark logo used in Nav
- [x] Make sure to re‑add the Nominate button in the Navbar


All NavBar checklist items in 4_16_25_NavBar.md have been completed and marked as done:

1. Added "Nominate Now" button to both desktop and mobile navigation sections in index.html, matching the intended call-to-action style.
2. Increased spacing between "Powered by Mindgrub" and the bottom of the navbar by adding `padding-bottom: 10px;` to the .powered-by CSS class in css/global.css.
3. Confirmed and ensured that the "Nominate Now" button is present in the navbar as required.

Each checklist item was addressed in order, following the specified assignment logic for code and style changes, and the file 4_16_25_NavBar.md was updated after each step.
