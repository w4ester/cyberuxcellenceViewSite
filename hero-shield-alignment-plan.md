# Hero Shield Icon Alignment Plan

## Current Analysis

After examining the hero section code and the provided screenshots, I can see that the shield icon needs to be repositioned to connect more closely with the corner of the hero section.

### Current Implementation

The shield icon is currently positioned as follows:
- Positioned absolutely with `bottom: -50px; right: 0;`
- Rotated 45 degrees counterclockwise with `transform: rotate(-45deg)`
- Using responsive sizing: `width/height: clamp(600px, 35vw, 800px)`
- Opacity set to 0.4
- At smaller screen sizes, it moves further away from the corner:
  - 1200px breakpoint: `right: 2%; bottom: -40px;`
  - 991px breakpoint: `right: -50px; bottom: -30px;`
  - 768px breakpoint: `right: -70px; bottom: -20px;`

### Issue

The current positioning doesn't allow the shield's corner to properly align with the edge of the hero section. There's too much space between the shield's corner and the section edge.

## Proposed Solution

To improve the shield icon alignment so its corner connects more closely with the edge of the hero section, I recommend the following adjustments:

1. **Base Position Adjustments**:
   - Adjust the `bottom` value to position the shield higher (from -50px to -20px)
   - Modify the `right` value to position it closer to the corner (from 0 to -10%)
   - Fine-tune the rotation angle to better align the shield's corner (from -45deg to -35deg)

2. **Responsive Adjustments**:
   - Update each breakpoint with appropriate positioning values to maintain the corner alignment across different screen sizes

3. **Specific CSS Changes**:

```css
/* Base positioning */
.hero-section .hero-bg-icon {
  bottom: -20px; /* Move higher (from -50px) */
  right: -10%; /* Move further right (from 0) */
  transform: rotate(-35deg); /* Adjust rotation (from -45deg) */
}

/* Breakpoint adjustments */
@media (max-width: 1200px) {
  .hero-section .hero-bg-icon {
    right: -8%; /* From 2% */
    bottom: -25px; /* From -40px */
  }
}

@media (max-width: 991px) {
  .hero-section .hero-bg-icon {
    right: -10%; /* From -50px */
    bottom: -20px; /* From -30px */
  }
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .hero-section .hero-bg-icon {
    right: -15%; /* From -70px */
    bottom: -15px; /* From -20px */
  }
}
```

## Expected Outcome

These changes will position the shield so that its corner connects more naturally with the edge of the hero section, matching the desired look in your reference screenshot. The shield will maintain this positioning relationship across different screen sizes while still maintaining its visual impact.

## Implementation Approach

1. Make the CSS changes to adjust the shield positioning
2. Test across multiple screen sizes to ensure the shield remains correctly positioned
3. Fine-tune the values if needed based on testing results
